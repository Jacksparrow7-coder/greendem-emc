🌿 Greendem Clone

This is my third project developed as part of my journey in the EMC Academy. The project is a 3-page responsive website built entirely using HTML and Tailwind CSS, without any JavaScript.

The design is inspired by eco-friendly and plant-based themes, reflecting a minimal and nature-focused aesthetic.
