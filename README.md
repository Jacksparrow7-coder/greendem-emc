# 🌿 Greendem Clone

This is my **third project** developed as part of my journey in the **EMC Academy**.  
The project is a **3-page responsive website** built entirely using **HTML** and **Tailwind CSS**, without any JavaScript.  

The design is inspired by eco-friendly and plant-based themes, reflecting a minimal and nature-focused aesthetic.
